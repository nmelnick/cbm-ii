# Meanwell Bracket for B128

Provides a somewhat reasonable bracket to mount a 
[Meanwell RT-65B](https://www.meanwell.com/productPdf.aspx?i=484)
power supply to the existing power supply mount in the Commodore B128. This was
created by measuring the posts within the case, and merging that base bracket
with an [existing mount](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4789768).

You may use M3 screws to mount the PSU to the bracket, and the existing screws
to mount the bracket to the case. The edge of the bracket should face the rear
of the case so that the wires drop down the middle.

## Print Settings

I have a Neptune 3, and the print area is slightly smaller than the bracket. I
end up rotating it on its side, and shifting the bracket 45 degrees on the Z
axis to fit my print area. If your print area is large enough, print with the
larger base on the bed, and no supports.

## Future Work

Add mounting holes for a fan.

Once a tick circuit is finished, I'd like to add a place to mount it on this
bracket.
