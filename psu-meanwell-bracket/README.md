# Meanwell Bracket for B128

Provides a somewhat reasonable bracket to mount a 
[Meanwell RT-65B](https://www.meanwell.com/productPdf.aspx?i=484)
power supply to the existing power supply mount in the Commodore B128. This was
created by measuring the posts within the case, and merging that base bracket
with an [existing mount](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4789768).

You may use M3 screws to mount the PSU to the bracket, and the existing screws
to mount the bracket to the case. The edge with the side coming up should face
the keyboard, allowing the wiring to come out toward the left of the case.

## Print Settings

I have a Neptune 3, and the print area is slightly smaller than the bracket. I
end up rotating the x-axis just enough for it to turn green, watching carefully
for the perimeter generated during slicing.
